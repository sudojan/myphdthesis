Each line contains (in this order)

the (anti)neutrino energy in GeV,
the cross section in pb for CC scattering,
the relative upper uncertainty for CC scattering,
the relative lower uncertainty for CC scattering,
the antineutrino in pb cross section for NC scattering,
the relative upper uncertainty for NC scattering and
the relative lower uncertainty for NC scattering.
